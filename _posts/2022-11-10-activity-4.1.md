## Activity 4.1 â€“ US Environmental History and Major Regulations

---

Environmentalism in America got it's start as early as the mid 18th century, figured like Jared Eliot had advocated for better 
methods to manage their land for farming and husbandry (Theis and Tomkin 2014).
However, the vast quantity of lands and resources available in America made it difficult for people early on to see the value in
environmental policies.
It wasn't until the mid 19th century, as America started to shift from an agrarian population to a increasingly urban population,
people started to consider land use policies, and providing environmental goods and services to the community (Theis and Tomkin 2014).
As more demand grew, farms started to experience soil errosion and infertility, leading to decreased crop yields (Theis and Tomkin 2014).
Farmers were no longer able to simply move into more land, as less fertile land became available paired with issues transporting goods
to market.

In the 1830's the Transcendental Movement was started by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Individuals started to value a strong connection with
nature, focusing on human-environmental interactions and re-envisioning the social contract of humanity with nature (Theis and Tomkin 2014).
Figures like Theodore Roosevelt and John Muir were responsible for pushing for setting up national parks to preserve lands for
future generations to enjoy.
However, after the First World War and through the Great Depression, depressed economic activity eroded the conservation movements,
  leading to clear cutting and ignoring soil conservation leading to dust storms between the 1920's and 1950's (Theis and Tomkin 2014).
After World War 2 and into the 1960's, air, water and soil quality suffered as industry started booming, leading to rising health concerns.
Incidents like the 1969 Cuyahoga River Fire sparked renewed interests in environmentalism leading to many policy changes to better
increase environmental quality.
