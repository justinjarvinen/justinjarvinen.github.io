Natural Resources are the things that we use and consume that come from our natural environment.
Natural Resource can be divided into 2 types, renewable and non-renewable resources.
Renewable resources can be things like solar energy, wind, trees, and fish; things that can replenished or there is so much abundance
its limit is practically unlimited.
Conversely, non-renewable energy cannot be replenish, things like mineral ore such as aluminum or steel; meanwhile fossil fuels
like oil and natural gas replenish so slowly that we consider them functionally non-renewable. 
So it naturally follows that once we run out of non-renewable resources there is no way to get anymore, but we can also run
out of renewable resources if there is no sustainability in place. 
For example if logging is done at a rate greater than new trees can be replanted and grown, we will eventually run out of tree.
If we over aggressively fish water without letting the population replenish, we can run out of fish. 
Without practicing sustainability we are led into a condition referred to as an unstable situation. 

We can practice sustainability and conservation by reducing the needs to extract resources from the environment, or using 
alternatives referred to as synthetics. 
Synthetics can be used for economic reasons, like with plastics being cheaper and more versatile.
It can also be used for environmental reasons such as replacing steel with more abundant aluminum or switching to electric cars
in-place of gas powered cars.
Synthetics can also tie into sustainability, as alternative materials used can be recycled and reused.
