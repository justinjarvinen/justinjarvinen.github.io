## Air Pollution Basics

### Sulfur Pollutants

Sulfur pollutants mainly consist of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S), and Sulfur Oxides (SOX). 
Pollution from sulfur can have multiple affects on the environment, including impaired visibility due to hazing (Freedman 2018), 
as well as health issue respiratory issues for people with asthma and damage plant life (US EPA 2022).
Sulfur pollution was a particularly large issue for people back in the beginning of the industrial revolution, as power was
largely generated from coal, however even today most of the 150 million tonnes of SO2 pollution occur from fossil fuel combustion (Freedman 2018).
Other natural sources of sulfur pollution are volcanoes, however on average they emit around 12 million tonnes of sulphur gasses
per year (Freedman 2018).

### Nitrogen Pollutants

Nitrogen Pollutants occur from many different types of nitrogen gasses, including Nitric Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), 
Nitrous Oxide (N2O), and Ammonia (NH3), NO and NO2 are combined to the term NOX (Freedman 2018).
Ammonia (NH3) emmissions are mostly natural, with 1.2 billion tonnes stemming from the decomposition of dead biomass, NH3 is
eventually converted to Nitrate after seven days (Freedman 2018).
Nitrous Oxide (N2O) is also known as laughing gas, and can be used a mild anesthetic. 
Nitric Oxide and Nitrogen Dioxide, often referred together as NOX, have around 430 million tonnes of natural emissions per year
due to bacterial dentrification, as well as 83 million tonnes per year due to burning of fossil fuels (Freedman 2018).
Rarely are there any concentrations of Nitrogen gases that cause cause harm to human, however nitrogen gasses can lead to the 
production of ozone which is much more problematic.
