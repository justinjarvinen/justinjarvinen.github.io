### What I Most Look Forward to in My Environmental Science Classi

What I look forward to most for this class is learning about different types of environments, how they work and how we have an affect on them.

### What I Think This Class Will Be About

I think this class will be about various types of environments in the world, and how they function.
I'm hoping that the class will include the different types of resources from our environments, how they are used and conserved and how 
we can shape different policies to manage our environments and resources.
