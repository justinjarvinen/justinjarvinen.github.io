## Module 1.2 - A Turning Point Event for Environmental Science

I watched the video "Celebrating the Comeback of the Burning River, 1969-2019"

## 1. Point of View

The video from the Ohio EPA explains the past pollution of the Cuyahoga River which lead to the river
catching on fire in 1969. This event served as a wake up call that the river could not be used as 
a dumping ground for industry without having serious environmental impacts around them. The striking 
image of a river caught on fire provided a caution that things needed to chage.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of the video was to revisit the past events that caused the river to catch on fire, and from that
event led to the clean up efforts. After cleanup of the river it became a place people wanted to visit
and be around which caused the region to consider how to properly manage the river for the wildlife, those
who wanted to use the river for recreation and commerce. 

## 3. Questions at Issue

One of the main questions following the burning of the river was how to even clean it up. At the time
the knowledge and processes of cleaning the water infrastructure didn't exist. So those tasked with 
cleaning the river were left to experiment, invent and invest into the clean water education. After
the river was cleaned more questions arose about the river, now that wild life was returning to the 
river there was discussions about removing older infrastructure further along the river to allow fish
to traverse further into the river.

## 8. Consequences

While the pollution of the river was devastating, and the cleanup required seemed like it would never end,
the efforts to improve the river created a wide positive impact on the river and the area around it.
Restaurants that would have never been able to operate around the polluted river were now opening, the 
area had been revitalized as a destination to go to for recreation. The river also saw the reintroduction
of fish and other wildlife. Half way down the river, a dam built intended to be used as a hydroelectric 
generator was never used. Now the Ohio EPA wants to remove the dams to return the river to its naturally
flowing state.
