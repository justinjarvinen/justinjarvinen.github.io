Image of the Cuyahoga River on fire, 1969.

## 1. Point of View

The video from the Ohio EPA explains the past pollution of the Cuyahoga River which lead to the river
catching on fire in 1969. This event served as a wake up call that the river could not be used as 
a dumping ground for industry without having serious environmental impacts around them. The striking 
image of a river caught on fire provided a caution that things needed to chage.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of the video was to revisit the past events that caused the river to catch on fire, and from that
event led to the clean up efforts. After cleanup of the river it became a place people wanted to visit
and be around which caused the region to consider how to properly manage the river for the wildlife, those
who wanted to use the river for recreation and commerce. 

## 3. Questions at Issue

One of the main questions following the burning of the river was how to even clean it up. At the time
the knowledge and processes of cleaning the water infrastructure didn't exist. So those tasked with 
cleaning the river were left to experiment, invent and invest into the clean water education. After
the river was cleaned more questions arose about the river, now that wild life was returning to the 
river there was discussions about removing older infrastructure further along the river to allow fish
to traverse further into the river.

## 4. Information

Due to the lack of regulation and the heavy industry setup around Cuyahoga river, it became as Bob Wysenski
put it "...it was almost an alien environment.". Bob also described the river as "the noise was deafening,
the air was choking, and the river, just depending on what day you were there, there was oil, there was 
pickle liquor, it was flowing orange red.".

Elaine Marsh of Summit MetroParks described the monumental task of cleaning the river, "There wasn't an
understanding of what we could do to make it better. We did not have any of the technologies that we have
now."

## 5. Interpretation and Inference

Bill Zawiski says, that sums up the purpose of the video well, "What happened on the Cuyahoga river, has 
benefited the entire world, just because it put this 'hey water quality can get so bad'... ". The video
show that we are able to face the damage that we caused the environment and help undo that damage
to create a place that benefits everyone.

## 6. Concepts

Gorge dam, represents the largest unresolved water quality issue on the Cuyahoga river. There is a 
dam pool that is 1.5 miles behind the dam that does not meet Ohio EPA's water quality standers. 
Removing the dam would restore water quality to that 1.5 mile stretch and allow the fish to traverse 
further down river. Additionally by removing the damn and restoring the natural flow of the river, it
would create miles of white water rapids that would attract tourists, spurring improvements into the 
local economy to develop more restaurants and hotels.

## 7. Assumptions

The International Joint Commission joined the Sierra Club, LTV Steel, and North East Ohio Sewer District 
to tackle the river issue. Early in the planning of what to do in order to resolve the issue with the river, 
there were differing opinions on what should be done and what goals they had in mind. With the first few
meetings there were doubts about whether they would be able to accomplish their goals with everyone 
being so guarded.

## 8. Consequences

While the pollution of the river was devastating, and the cleanup required seemed like it would never end,
the efforts to improve the river created a wide positive impact on the river and the area around it.
Restaurants that would have never been able to operate around the polluted river were now opening, the 
area had been revitalized as a destination to go to for recreation. The river also saw the reintroduction
of fish and other wildlife. Half way down the river, a dam built intended to be used as a hydroelectric 
generator was never used. Now the Ohio EPA wants to remove the dams to return the river to its naturally
flowing state.
