### What are microplastics

Microplastics are any plastic particle or fiber that are less than 5 millimeters (mm) in size (Haab and Haab 2016).
Larger plastic items such as plastic bags will also break down over time into ever smaller plastic particles (Dudas 2018)
Plastics are derived from crude oil and do not naturally decompose, so while these plastics are getting smaller and smaller, they
will never stop being plastic.
Microplastics can be found in cosmetic products, like products that advertise as exfoliating as well as in things like toothpaste (Haab and Haab 2016)
They can also be found/created in clothing, as more and more clothing uses plastic fibers in their textiles, microplastic waste can
get created when washing those clothes in washing machines (Dudas 2018).
Ultimately those microplastics are introduced into the environment, as plastic products are thrown away and microplastics are too small
to be filtered out during water treatment (Haab and Haab 2016).
