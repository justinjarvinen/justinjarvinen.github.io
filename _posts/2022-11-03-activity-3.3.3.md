### What are microplastics

Microplastics are any plastic particle or fiber that are less than 5 millimeters (mm) in size (Haab and Haab 2016).
Larger plastic items such as plastic bags will also break down over time into ever smaller plastic particles (Dudas 2018)
Plastics are derived from crude oil and do not naturally decompose, so while these plastics are getting smaller and smaller, they
will never stop being plastic.
Microplastics can be found in cosmetic products, like products that advertise as exfoliating as well as in things like toothpaste (Haab and Haab 2016)
They can also be found/created in clothing, as more and more clothing uses plastic fibers in their textiles, microplastic waste can
get created when washing those clothes in washing machines (Dudas 2018).
Ultimately those microplastics are introduced into the environment, as plastic products are thrown away and microplastics are too small
to be filtered out during water treatment (Haab and Haab 2016).

### Why are microplastic problematic

Ingestion of microplastics can have adverse impacts on aquatic lifeforms, as Haab and Haab noted, "Another study on deposit-feeding 
marine worms found that consistent exposure to sediments contaminated with microplastics led to reduced feeding activity, longer 
gut residency time of ingested materials, and inflammation, all of which led to an overall depletion of the worms‘ energy reserves 
by 50% (Wright et al. 2013a)" (Haab and Haab 2016).
This can also cause a knock on effect, as microplastics introduced to organisms at the bottom of the food chain can carry those 
microplastics up the food chain as they are consumed.

This can also cause indirect issues within aquatic environments, microplastics can reduce the maximum tempature soils can reach while
increasing the time it takes to heat up, as Haab and Haab note, "...microplastics impact water movement and heat transfer within 
sediments, which could have significant impacts on organisms that live in sediments for all or part of their life cycle and on 
overall ecosystem structure and function." (Haab and Haab 2016).

Finally microplastics can impart an indirect impact on environments through it's ability to absorb and leach toxic organic contaminants
to sediments and lifeforms. Toxins can be introduced to the microplastics from additives used during manfucaturing or absorb from
the surrounding water, acting as a sponge for toxins (Haab and Haab 2016). Toxins can also be introduced to microplastics as it makes
it way through wastewater, ending up in terristrial soil. Haab and Haab note on the toxicity of these microplastics "Due to this tendency, a single plastic microbead
can be one million times more toxic than the water around it" (Haab and Haab 2016).
