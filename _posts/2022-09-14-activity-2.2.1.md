## Activity 2.2.1  â€“ My daily water use

---

To figure out my average gallons of water used per month I first needed to get my water usage from my last 3 water bills.
I took the average of these bills and divided by 3.5, to account for my son-in-law who spends half the time at our house.

```
June - 8977 gallons
July - 5237 gallons
August - 3740 gallons

8977 + 5237 + 3740 = 17954 / 3 = 5984 average gallons per month
5984 / 3.5 people = 1709 average gallons per person per month
1709 / 30 days = 57 average gallons per person per day
```


|Name of Water Calculator | URL | Per Person Usage |
|---|---|---|
|SAWS water bill | N/A | 57 gallons per person per day | 
|Home Water Works | https://home-water-works.org/calculator | 92 gallons per person per day |
|Chelan County P.U.D. | https://www.chelanpud.org/conservationhome/water-conservation/water-use-calculator | 192 gallons per day / 3 = 64 gallons per person per day |


An additional stat that I was able to find on my water bill was the average water use for my neighborhood which averaged 
around 7300 gallons.
Another stat that I found interesting was that Home Water Works breaks down calculated usage by category, where outdoor water usage
accounted for nearly 2/3 of estimated water usage.
I think the reason that Home Water Works ends up being further off from my own and Chelan Couty P.U.D's estimates is that it uses
its own duration and water discharge rate to calculate how much water is used to irrigate the lawn.
One change that I have made over the summer, and I think reflects on my water bills and neighborhood comparison, is that I drastically 
reduced lawn watering as the Edwards Aquifer levels dropped below stage 2 and stage 3.
As a result, my lawn had either mostly died out or have gone dormant.
As my lawn dies out I am looking at moving away from Bermuda grass, that does not fair well under drought conditions, and moving to
a species better suited for the areas climate.
