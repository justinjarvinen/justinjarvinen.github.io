## Activity 2.2.1  â€“ My daily water use

---

To figure out my average gallons of water used per month I first needed to get my water usage from my last 3 water bills.
I took the average of these bills and divided by 3.5, to account for my son-in-law who spends half the time at our house.

```
June - 8977 gallons
July - 5237 gallons
August - 3740 gallons

8977 + 5237 + 3740 = 17954 / 3 = 5984 average gallons per month
5984 / 3.5 people = 1709 average gallons per person per month
1709 / 30 days = 57 average gallons per person per day
```
