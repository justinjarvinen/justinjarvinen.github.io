#### Chapter 4 Mind Map - Energy
This map shows how energy is measured, how it is transformed, and how ecosystems are organized.

#### Chapter 7 Mind Map - Biodiversity
This map describes biodiversity, how it is used, what use it provides, and how we classify organisms.

#### Chapter 8 Mind Map - Biomes
This map organizes the different type of biomes and ecozones that we use.

This assignment was about turning the information in chapters 4, 7, and 8, and turning them into concept maps to provide a overview
of the content in each chapter. Using the tool text2mindmap from https://tobloef.com, I created maps that orgaize the information 
into digestable chunks.

In chapters 4 we learn about energy, how it is measured, transformated, and the ecosystems that use that energy. 
For example, we learn that plants are autotrophs, also called primary producers.
Those primary producers receive their energy from the sun, in turn herbivores eat the plants to aquire their energy, and even still
carnivores eat the herbivores for their own energy.
Chapter 4 also describes how we measure that energy, through units like joules or calories.

In chapter 7 we learned about biodiversity and the different value and services that it provides.
An example of the different services biodiversity provides is providing oxygen and removing CO2, which is vital to poviding life 
a habital environment. 
We also learned about the kinds of value biodiversity can provide, such as medicines derived from vegatation or from parts of animals.
Apart from a utilitarian value that biodiversity provides, there is also the intrinsic value, along with the value of preesrving these
different environments for less tangible reasons.

Finally in chapter 8 we learned about biomes, with both major biomes which represent large definitions or regions and ecozones/ecoregions
that use more inputs to define a specific region.
Biomes can be broken into two different types, land and aqauatic. 
While land biomes are generally defined by the established vegatation in the area, aqauatic are usually defined by the dominant animal.
Even still, ecozones and ecoregions attempt to provide a more focused definition for species in a region. 
More factors play into how a ecozone or ecoregion is defined, such as climate, landform, and even soil, vegtation and land use.
