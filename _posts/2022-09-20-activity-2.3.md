#### Chapter 4 Mind Map - Energy
This map shows how energy is measured, how it is transformed, and how ecosystems are organized.

#### Chapter 7 Mind Map - Biodiversity
This map describes biodiversity, how it is used, what use it provides, and how we classify organisms.

This assignment was about turning the information in chapters 4, 7, and 8, and turning them into concept maps to provide a overview
of the content in each chapter. Using the tool text2mindmap from https://tobloef.com, I created maps that orgaize the information 
into digestable chunks.

In chapters 4 we learn about energy, how it is measured, transformated, and the ecosystems that use that energy. 
For example, we learn that plants are autotrophs, also called primary producers.
Those primary producers receive their energy from the sun, in turn herbivores eat the plants to aquire their energy, and even still
carnivores eat the herbivores for their own energy.
