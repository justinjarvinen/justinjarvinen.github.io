## Petermann Glacier, Greenland - 1999 to 2022

The Petermann Glacier is a large glacier located on the northern shores of Greenland. 
Satellite images captured over the last 20 years shows the changes that have taken place.

## Problem

The Petermann Glacier is one of Greenland's largest marine-terminating glaciers, meaning the terminus of the glacier comes into
direct contact with the ocean. 
Satellite imagery from US Geological Service(USGS), show that since 1999 the glacier has been receding further back.
This is caused by ice breaking off of the glacier and floating into the ocean, this act referred to as calving.
Calving is a normal process of glaciers, however when the rate of calving exceeds the rate that the glacier is recharged, 
geologists are left to determined if the acceleration is caused by global warming, and what the affects that might have.
