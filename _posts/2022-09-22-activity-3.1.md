## Activity 3.1 â€“ Human Population

---

| Country Name | Birth Rate | Death Rate | Pop Growth Rate | Life Expectancy (Total/Male/Female) | Fertility Rate | GNI | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Findland | 8 | 10 | -0.1 | T=82 M=79 F=84 | 1.4 | 51,650 |
| Burundi | 36 | 6 | 3.0 | T=67 M=65 F=69 | 5.2 | 780 | 

One of the striking differences between a more developed country and a lesser developed country revolves around birth rates. 
Many factory can lead to an inflated or deflated birthrate, however as humans we tend to trend toward a carrying capacity for their
environment, also called a K level.
Humans have a good survivorship, meaning the majority of the population tends to fare well in death until reaching life expectancy.
In Burundi's case we see wildly different numbers when compared to Finland, with a birth rate over 4x as much and  average life
expectancy of 15 years less. 
With Burundi's birth rate at 36, you can determine they have not reached their carrying capacity for their region, however also
factoring in their infant mortality rate of 42 and a you can make a reasonable assumption that there are additional factors at play.
For example a high mortality rate can be indicative of under developed, or unaccessible healthcare. 
Additional factors that could lead to lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality rates could be density independent, such as 
natural disasters that the region is unable to cope with, as well as political or regional conflicts.
